    <h2>
    My identity and values
    </h2>
    <h3>Core personal values</h3>
    My initial thoughts on this topic is that personal values, per se, in my view and experience are not set in stone but are fluid to a large degree. <br>
    <br>
    External influences have a huge impact on who we are and how we act. Often there can also be incongruence between how we see ourselves and how others see us.<br>
    <br>
    E xternal and internal viewpoints can and often are at odds with each other. <br>
    <br>
    For me my personal core views are now very simple. <br>
    <br>
    I try to be a good person most of the time, and enjoy life. <br>
    <br>
    These concepts can be endlessly branched out into other more detailed concepts, but these are currently what I see are pretty honest to who I am these days. <br>
    
    <h3>Defined by others</h3>
    When I ask my loved ones, who I am I would get the following interesting responses:<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Garrett is or can be:</strong>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Extremely caring</li>
    <li>Very kind</li>
    <li>Very hard-working</li>
    <li>Very giving</li>
    <li>At times brutally honest</li>
    <li>Direct</li>
    <li>Stubborn</li>
    </ul>
    I can be deeply tribalistic and loyal to my loved ones, my team and my tribe.<br>
    <br>
    A good word for my personality is the quality of being “earnest”. When those around me are unwell or in some other type of physical pain or need I am exceptionally good at attending to or taking care of people. To sometimes the sacrifice of my own needs.<br><br>

    On the other hand, in other situations I can be quite impatient, just ask my kids, my partner and my parents.<br> 
    <br>
    Growing up I was fairly introverted, and this was probably heightened to a degree when I attended art school after high school, but I really had to come out of my shell when I became a professional firefighter and I was exposed to a direct, in-your-face, un-PC, physical and macho environment.<br>
    <br>
    Paramilitary-style training and the chain of command really resonated with me at the time and I was able to develop a keen attention to detail and the ability to simply follow orders, the certainty of knowing what you need to do in this type of environment was quite freeing at the age of 22-23.<br>
    <br>
    In that sort of environment, you are expected to sometimes perform individually, and without reliance on others around you, you are forced to "step-up". And those sort of experiences have made me somewhat brash in some interactions with people.<br>
    <br> 
    Following around 7 years with the then named NZ Fire Service, I became a lawyer, and over the last decade I dealt with sometimes very difficult cases involving issues such as; child kidnapping; human rights issues not to mention countless other less interesting and more routine matters.<br>
    
    <h3>Limitations</h3>
    I can be direct, stubborn and brutally honest. But I feel I have found enough self-awareness to be able to be cognisant of others when diplomacy is required and I need to be mindful of other's feelings.<br><br>
    In some unique cases (legal disputes, negotiations) directness and even stubbornness can be an asset, but this very rarely crosses over to non litigious scenarios.,<br>
    <br>
    Furthermore, even in the legal world for sometime there has been a shift towards soft skills such as mediation and alternative forms of dispute resolution. <br>
    <br>
    One of my other limitations, is that I also overestimate my abilities or underestimate the complexity of a task, but in mitigation I am the first to admit this and I will openly seek out assistance or reach out for help.
    <h3>Ethical dilemas</h3>
    I encountered many ethical dilemmas when I was a lawyer, for example when I needed to act in the best interests of my clients but some issue, such as a client wanting to provide some false evidence to support their position arose.<br>
    <br>
    In those situations I relied not just on my own moral or professional compass or judgment but ensured I spoke with others who had dealt with similar situations before or were in the same line as work, i.e. other lawyers.<br>
    </br>
    Over time, ethical dilemmas didn't arise as often as a clear understanding of my responsibilities as a lawyer and my duty to the court became crystal clear, and a clear framework of how to analyse situations and deal with them developed.<br>
    <br>
    I also ensured that I discuss issues with others as soon as I have any inkling of any ethical issues, so as to get in-front or ahead of issues as soon as possible rather than allowing things to snowball and creating much more stress and complexity further down the track. <br>
    
    <h3>Influence of culture</h3>
    With introspection comes understanding and insight. My cultural values and identity have been developed from my family, my friends, my experiences and learning. <br>
    <br>
    It is easier to explain to illustrate with examples; <br>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Growing up with work class parents, I have always found more connection and common experience with working class </li>
    <li>I grew up and bonded closely with Maori and Pacific Islanders and often align with similar value sets</li>
    <li>I enjoy collaborative group dynamics but also find the need for individual pursuits</li>
    <li>I am more than happy to hear and receive criticism of myself (I am my greatest critic), but I do not tolerate bullying having experienced the later on multiple occasions in my early years</li></ul>
    
    <h3>On balance</h3>
    I believe that my desire to succeed coupled with my hard-working ethic will aid me in my career and learning development. <br>
    <br>
    My limitations will come from time management in a flipped environment and where there are so many avenues to look for solutions and to develop my own script, my endless curiosity may trip myself up unless I learn to be very strict with my time. <br>
    <h3>Working with others</h3>
    I can't remember any examples of working productively with others as it has been sometime due to the nature of my work, but I do remember instances when in group activites at University the group for the most part had decided on one method or path, but I still had reservations about whether it was the best way or not. <br>
    <br>
    My solution in those situations was to try and gently suggest my solution or suggestion and if it was not accepted by the group, to simply let go of my ego and accept the group solution and to do my best to leave my reservations behind and to continue with the task I had been assigned by the group.<br>
    <br>
    I am keenly aware, we are not always right and we can't always see what others can. Furthermore forcing an issue on the majority is likely to do far more damage than good.
