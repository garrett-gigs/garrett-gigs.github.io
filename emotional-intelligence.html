    <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>

    At the heart of EQ is the ability to identify and manage ones own emotions as well as the emotions of others. <br>
  
    
    
    <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
    
    IQ is  measured by knowledge of subjects and information and the ability to complete maths tasks in a standardised testing model. IQ represents abilities such as: 
    <ul>
        <li>Visual and spacial processing</li> 
        <li>Visual and spacial processing</li>
        <li>Fluid reasoning</li>
        <li> Working memory and short-term  memory</li>
        <li> Working memory and short-term  memory</li>
    </ul>
    
    On the otherhand EQ relates to abilities such as: <br>
    <ul>
    <li>Identifying emotions</li>    
    <li>Evaluating how others feel</li>
    <li>Controlling one's own emotions</li> 
    <li>Perceiving how others feel</li>	
    <li>Using emotions to facilitate social communication</li>
    <li>Relating to others</li>
    </ul>    
    
    EQ is also not measureable. <br> <br>
    
    
    <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
    
    The views of many is that success in the workplace (and indeed the home) is more dependent on EQ than IQ. In some articles writers/researchers state that success is 80% EQ and only 20% IQ. Further to success the view is that greater EQ will lead to greater happiness that IQ on its own will not achieve. <br> <br>
