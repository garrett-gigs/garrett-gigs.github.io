        <strong>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</strong><br>
        <br>
        
        <p>My longterm goal is to be working as a full stack developer or a software developer. I envision starting as a junior developer and then developing my skills and experience for a couple years. Taking advice from others in the industry I will try to gain experience or at least some exposure to areas outside of general web development that interest me including:
        
            <ul><li>Blockchain development </li>
                <li>Game development</li> 
            <Li>Ethical hacking</Li></ul>
            
        
        </p>
        
        <strong>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</strong> <br>
        <br>
        
        <strong>Strengths</strong>
        
        <ul><li>Endless curiosity </li>
            <li>Broad research skills </li>
            <li>Work ethic</li>
            <li>Used to be a fan of Joe Rogan</li></ul>
        
        <strong>Weaknesses</strong>
       <ul> <li>Placing goals extremely high</li>
        <li>Poor time management as a result of high goals + endless curiosity + broad research skills</li>
    <li>Used to be a fan of Joe Rogan</li>
        </ul>
    
        
        
        <strong>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong><br>
        <br>
    
        Better listening skills, patience and more collaborative communication skills. I’ve worked in two areas (Law and emergency response) where a spade is called a spade,  words are not minced and where direct and robust discussion is the norm.<br> 
        <br>
        <strong>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
            <ul><li>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives</li>
                <li>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</li></ul></strong>
        
        
        Managing my own productivity with others requires me to keep in better sync with those around me and to be more accountable to setting goals and KEEPING TO TIME BOXES.<br>
        <br>
        Safety is about respect, awareness and kindness. This is a unique environment where the ultimate gaol is to learn and achieve betterment of oneself within a cohort. Supporting each other is a key element and this includes not only learning and skills development, but also self development. I’m excited to learn from others’ life experiences and learn more about the world through others.<br>
        <br>
    
        <strong>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</strong> <br>
        <br>
        
        I can sometimes overestimate my skills and assume that I will be able to complete something in a much shorter time and in a much smoother way than I actually can. This is probably because I was very comfortable in my previous job and everything became almost too routine in some ways. Sprint 2 is a solid lesson in humility, I spent days on blog elements that I thought I should be able to turn out quickly, but it simply wasn’t that easy and straightforward. I should’ve sought out help much sooner, rather than towards the end when I was running out of time!<br>
        <br>
        
        <strong>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</strong><br>
        <br>
        The facilitation team will provide only as much as I can give. They have other students to look after, and any assistance I need has to be sought out in a reasonable time frame and on reasonable terms. In a flipped classroom we are our own teachers to a large extent.<br>
        <br>
        It’s my responsibility to monitor my own needs and be proactive engaging with facilitators and other students. <br>
        <br>
        
        <strong>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.
        </strong>    <br>
        <br>I must also manage my own time effectively and ensure that I can balance the course load with other responsibilities that I have i.e. kids.
