    <h2>The house that <strong>HTML and CSS</strong> built.</h2>
 
    <p>
    When you are building a house, the job is complex and involved but can for arguments sake be split up into two areas, main construction and finishing. <br>
    <br>
    The first thing to be done in the construction phase is to lay foundations, frame the house, set up rooms, walls and ceilings and ultimately finalise the main physical aspects of a house. This is what HTML does in web development. <br>
    <br>
    After this is done the job is passed over the finishing team, plasterers, painters, and decorators. In this final phase this is where <em>"styling"</em> is added to a house. This is exactly what CSS does.<br>
    <br>
    CSS doesn't add major elements to the house for the most part, but on top of superficial styling it also maintains the look of the house as things change, as parts are added to the house, CSS ensures they continue to work together smoothly.<br>
    <br>
    CSS adds flexibility to HTML so users of different types, can view HTML content regardless of where they are looking from i.e. what sort of device.<br>
    <Br>
     The relationship between CSS and HTML is one of reciprocity and reliance, they work together in unison to provide the best user experience of displaying information and web based content to users.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Javascript control flow and loops</h2>
    <p>
    Control flow in Javascript is like looking at a complex assembly line for electronics. There is set order in which parts are but together, for example starting with step A runnning all the way to step Z.,<br>
    <br>
    This is the fundamental order in which things are done.<br>
    <br>
    In code, the order runs from top to bottom or the first line to the last in a page of code. But much like in assembly, often there needs to be changes to the control flow or the assembly of devices.<br>
    <br>
    In an assembly plant, a device may be diverted from the fundamental control flow, for example if an item fails a quality control check and the assembly flow may be diverted to another area of the plant for checking and fixing before being diverted back into the control flow.<br>
    <br>
    Other examples maybe when certain conditions are satisfied, such as x number of units being made, or x hundred hours of operation, then a further stop event is triggered.<br>
    <br>
    Such cycles of repetition, with a particular defined stop condition are, in the coding environment called  <em>loops</em>.<br><br>
    Loops are very useful and allow for automated actions to occur until certain predined conditions are met.<br><br>
    </p>
    <h2>The DOM</h2>
    <p>
    The DOM is a programming inferface for viewing web documents. Instead of just looking at raw HTML, CSS and Javascript, the DOM organises web document information according to a "forest" or "grove" logical struction.<br><br>
    The DOM can be used to directly modify the content and visual presentation of a web document. In this case it can be used as a much more hands on way of altering web documents, then say simply editing HTML or CSS. <br><br>
    <h2>Arrays and objects</h2>
    Arrays and objects are special data types in Javascript and they work in at times similar and at times different ways.<br><br>
    Both arrays and objects are <em>mutable</em> meaning that their values <em>do</em>change in value when you use them.<br><br>
    Objects are used to represent basically anything that is made up or can be represented by a set of characteristics or properties.<br><br>
    On the other hand, arrays are used to create and store a list of multiple items in a <em>single</em>variable.<br><br>
    Accessing data from an object is done by using dot or bracket notation, whereas to access data from an array you use a work command such as push().<br><br>
    <h2>Functions</h2>
    A function in Javascript performs tasks or calculations via a set of logic based arguments or statements. It takes information on the input side, such as information from an array or object and then outputs after the information is processed following the function statements.
