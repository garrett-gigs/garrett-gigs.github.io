    <h2>
      What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core
      learning?
    </h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Being hard on oneself is counter-productive, even if there are challenges and obstacles and
        you are slipping behind or not getting things, be kind to oneself, not just to others.
      </li>
      <li>
        That I need to overcome years of bad habits, such as dealing with learning blocks in a more
        productive manner than just throwing my head against a wall repeatedly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Abandon ego and ask for help early on, help is not cheating so long as it isn't simply one
        person giving you the answer
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>

    Values help stablised one's responses in response to varying degrees of stress and build a
    character of a person that others will respect and love.<br /><br />
    Empathy builds genuine connections with others and helps demonstrate to oneself how one should
    act towards oneself. It's often easiest to treat others better than you treat yourself.
    <br /><br />
    Self-awareness, at least in principle, is part of the solution to finding a way to deal with all
    manner of negative or challenging experiences or self-talk. Self-awarness is the key to
    unlocking freedom from the confines of one's own past experiences and trauma.

    <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>

    That it offered the opportunity for so much potential growth when at my stage of life and
    experience I thought that I had a decent grasp of self and the world. <br /><br />
    It was both humbling and inspiring.
    <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
    The most challenging aspect was detaching myself and reassessing anew my deep seated attitudes
    to myself and others, that vividly conflicts with how I present myself on the surface, and
    detecting and grasping with these conflicts from a values and identity perspective. <br />

    <h2>
      Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning
      in a web development Bootcamp course?
    </h2>
    Because ultimately the ethos of EDA is to on a very simplistic level to ensure that every one of
    the students is given the full opportunity to be in a position to make the world a slighlty
    better place, by giving the chance for each of us to be more self-aware, to have better people
    and communcations skills to and to be better people for ourselves, and to be far more effective
    programmers.
    <h2>
      Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have
      just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
    </h2>
    I think that the time spent studying core learning is very important. <br /><br />
    It establishes a new baseline of awareness and core skills, and helps crystalise values and sets
    up students for bootcamp to ensure greater group connection, synergy and co-operation such that
    we will hopefully be far more able to learn, whilst supporting and bonding with each other thus
    maximising not only the opportunity for a successful bootcamp, on an individual level but also
    on a broader an organisational and community level as we join the wider Tech community.<br /><br />
